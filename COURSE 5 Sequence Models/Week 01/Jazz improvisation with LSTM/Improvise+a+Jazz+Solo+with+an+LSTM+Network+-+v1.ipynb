For example, if you press down a specific piano key for 0.5 seconds, then you have just played a note. In music theory, a \"value\" is actually more complicated than this--specifically, it also captures the information needed to play multiple notes at the same time. For example, when playing a music piece, you might press down two piano keys at the same time (playng multiple notes at the same time generates what's called a \"chord\").

For the purpose of this assignment, all you need to know is that we will obtain a dataset of values, and will learn an RNN model to generate sequences of values. \n",

    "Finally, you are ready to generate music. Your RNN generates a sequence of values. The following code generates music by first calling your `predict_and_sample()` function. These values are then post-processed into musical chords (meaning that multiple values or notes can be played at the same time). \n",

The post-processing does things such as clean up the generated audio by making sure the same sound is not repeated too many times, that two successive notes are not too far from each other in pitch, and so on. One could argue that a lot of these post-processing steps are hacks; also, a lot the music generation literature has also focused on hand-crafting post-processors, and a lot of the output quality depends on the quality of the post-processing and not just the quality of the RNN. But this post-processing does make a huge difference, so lets use it in our implementation as well. \n",
