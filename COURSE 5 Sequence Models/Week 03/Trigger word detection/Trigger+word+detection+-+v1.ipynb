    "In this week's videos, you learned about applying deep learning to speech recognition. In this assignment, you will construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wakeword detection). Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  \n",

    "For this exercise, our trigger word will be \"Activate.\" Every time it hears you say \"activate,\" it will make a \"chiming\" sound. By the end of this assignment, you will be able to record a clip of yourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying \"activate.\" \n",

    "Let's start by building a dataset for your trigger word detection algorithm. A speech dataset should ideally be as close as possible to the application you will want to run it on. In this case, you'd like to detect the word \"activate\" in working environments (library, home, offices, open-spaces ...). You thus need to create recordings with a mix of positive words (\"activate\") and negative words (random words other than activate) on different background sounds. Let's see how you can create such a dataset. \n",

The \"negatives\" directory contains negative examples of people saying random words other than \"activate\". There is one word per audio recording.

You can think of an audio recording is a long list of numbers measuring the little air pressure changes detected by the microphone. We will use audio sampled at 44100 Hz (or 44100 Hertz). This means the microphone gives us 44100 numbers per second. Thus, a 10 second audio clip is represented by 441000 numbers (= $10 \\times 44100$). \n",

The spectrogram tells us how much different frequencies are present in an audio clip at a moment in time. \n",

    "Given a 10sec background clip and a short audio clip (positive or negative word), you need to be able to \"add\" or \"insert\" the word's short audio clip onto the background. To ensure audio segments inserted onto the background do not overlap, you will keep track of the times of previously inserted audio clips. You will be inserting multiple clips of positive/negative words onto the background, and you don't want to insert an \"activate\" or a random word somewhere that overlaps with another clip you had previously added. \n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity, when you insert a 1sec \"activate\" onto a 10sec clip of cafe noise, you end up with a 10sec clip that sounds like someone sayng \"activate\" in a cafe, with \"activate\" superimposed on the background cafe noise. You do *not* end up with an 11 sec clip. You'll see later how pydub allows you to do this. \n",

    "\n",
    "Recall also that the labels $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ represent whether or not someone has just finished saying \"activate.\" Given a background clip, we can initialize $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}=0$ for all $t$, since the clip doesn't contain any \"activates.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "When you insert or overlay an \"activate\" clip, you will also update labels for $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$, so that 50 steps of the output now have target label 1. You will train a GRU to detect when someone has *finished* saying \"activate\". For example, suppose the synthesized \"activate\" clip ends at the 5sec mark in the 10sec audio---exactly halfway into the clip. Recall that $T_y = 1375$, so timestep $687 = $ `int(1375*0.5)` corresponds to the moment at 5sec into the audio. So, you will set $y^{\\langle 688 \\rangle} = 1$. Further, you would quite satisfied if the GRU detects \"activate\" anywhere within a short time-internal after this moment, so we actually set 50 consecutive values of the label $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ to 1. Specifically, we have $y^{\\langle 688 \\rangle} = y^{\\langle 689 \\rangle} = \\cdots = y^{\\langle 737 \\rangle} = 1$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is another reason for synthesizing the training data: It's relatively straightforward to generate these labels $y^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ as described above.
